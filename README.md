# Chat-Application
This project is a real-time messaging application built with a Spring Boot backend and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The application enables users to send and receive messages with a simple, user-friendly interface, allowing them to view messages in a traditional manner (their messages are aligned left, others' are aligned right).
